Supplementary methods for the paper "Characterization Factors for the Impact of Climate Change on Freshwater Fish Species"

The following files can be found in this repository:
• 1.SAR.R. This file contains all the code related to the development of the species-area relationship specific to riverine fish, i.e., for Fig S2. 
• 2.Effect_factors.R. This file contains all the code from basin-level threatened ranges to global extinction risk and global effect factors, i.e., for Fig 1 and S1, and Table S4.
• 3.Characterization_factors.R. This file contains all the code related to the global characterization factors, i.e., for the results in sections 3.2 and 3.4. 
• 4.Anova.R. This file contains all the code for the ANOVA analysis, i.e., for the results in Table 4 and Fig S6.
• 5.Contribution.R. This file contains all the code to calculate the grid cell contribution to global extinction risk. 
• 6.Plots_contribution.R. This file builds upon Contribution.R and uses the input to plot Figs. 2, S3, S4 and S5.
• 7.Biofuels.R.
