# Supplementary methods for the paper "Characterization Factors for the Impact of Climate Change on Freshwater Fish Species"

The following files can be found in this repository:
- *1.SAR.R.* This file contains all the code related to the development of the species-area relationship specific to riverine fish, i.e., for Fig. S3. 
- *2.Effect_factors.R.* This file contains all the code from basin-level threatened ranges to global extinction risk and global effect factors, i.e., for Figs. 1 and S1, and Table S4.
- *3.Characterization_factors.R.* This file contains all the code related to the global characterization factors, i.e., for Fig. 3 and the results in sections 3.2. 
- *4.Anova.R.* This file contains all the code for the ANOVA analysis, i.e., for the results in Table 1 and Fig. S2.
- *5.Contribution.R.* This file contains all the code to calculate the grid cell contribution to global extinction risk. 
- *6.Plots_contribution.R.* This file builds upon 5.Contribution.R and uses the input to plot Figs. 2, S4, S5 and S6.
- *7.Biofuels.R.* This file contains all the code for the LCA case study on transportation biofuels implementing the characterization factors derived from the code in 3.Characterization_factors.R, i.e., for the plot in Fig. 4 and Table S5.
