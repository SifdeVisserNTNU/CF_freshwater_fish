# Supplementary methods for the paper "Characterization Factors for the Impact of Climate Change on Freshwater Fish Species"

The following files can be found in this repository (src folder):
- *1.SAR.R.* This file contains all the code related to the development of the species-area relationship specific to riverine fish, i.e., for Fig. S2. 
- *2.Effect_factors.R.* This file contains all the code from basin-level threatened ranges to global extinction risk and global effect factors, i.e., for Figs. 2 and 3, and Table S4.
- *3.Characterization_factors.R.* This file contains all the code related to the global characterization factors, i.e., for Fig. 5 and the results in sections 3.4. 
- *4.Anova.R.* This file contains all the code for the ANOVA analysis, i.e., for the results in Table 1 and Fig. S1.
- *5.Contribution.R.* This file contains all the code to calculate the grid cell contribution to global extinction risk. 
- *6.Plots_contribution.R.* This file builds upon 5.Contribution.R and uses the input to plot Figs. 4, S3, S4 and S5.
- *7.Biofuels.R.* This file contains all the code for the LCA case study on transportation biofuels implementing the characterization factors derived from the code in 3.Characterization_factors.R, i.e., for the plot in Fig. 6.
